# 7 Tips to Get the Most Out of Nano Banana Pro

Nano Banana Pro is a massive upgrade built on Gemini 3, offering state-of-the-art text rendering, multi-image composition, and advanced creative controls. This guide covers how to craft effective prompts, refine details, and leverage the model's capabilities for professional results.

## 1. Establish the Vision: Story, Subject, and Style
To achieve the best results and nuanced control, structure your prompts with these key elements:

*   **Subject**: Who or what is in the image? Be specific.
    *   *Example*: "a stoic robot barista with glowing blue optics", "a fluffy calico cat wearing a tiny wizard hat"
*   **Composition**: How is the shot framed?
    *   *Example*: "extreme close-up", "wide shot", "low angle shot", "portrait"
*   **Action**: What is happening?
    *   *Example*: "brewing a cup of coffee", "casting a magical spell", "mid-stride running through a field"
*   **Location**: Where does the scene take place?
    *   *Example*: "a futuristic cafe on Mars", "a cluttered alchemist's library", "a sun-drenched meadow at golden hour"
*   **Style**: What is the overall aesthetic?
    *   *Example*: "3D animation", "film noir", "watercolor painting", "photorealistic", "1990s product photography"
*   **Editing Instructions**: For modifying existing images, be direct.
    *   *Example*: "change the man's tie to green", "remove the car in the background"

## 2. Refine the Details: Camera, Lighting, and Format
Move beyond basics to achieve professional-grade outputs by specifying:

*   **Composition and Aspect Ratio**: Define the canvas.
    *   *Example*: "A 9:16 vertical poster", "A cinematic 21:9 wide shot"
*   **Camera and Lighting**: Direct the shot like a cinematographer.
    *   *Example*: "A low-angle shot with a shallow depth of field (f/1.8)", "Golden hour backlighting creating long shadows", "Cinematic color grading with muted teal tones"
*   **Specific Text Integration**: State what text should appear and its style.
    *   *Example*: "The headline 'URBAN EXPLORER' rendered in bold, white, sans-serif font at the top"
*   **Factual Constraints**: For diagrams, specify accuracy needs.
    *   *Example*: "A scientifically accurate cross-section diagram", "Ensure historical accuracy for the Victorian era"
*   **Reference Inputs**: Define the role of uploaded images clearly.
    *   *Example*: "Use Image A for the character's pose, Image B for the art style, and Image C for the background environment"

## 3. Creative Techniques & Prompting Strategies
Nano Banana Pro supports a range of advanced capabilities:

1.  **Incredible Text Rendering**: Create impactful posters, diagrams, and product mockups with sharp, legible text.
    *   *Prompt*: "Create an image showing the phrase 'How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood' made out of wood chucked by a woodchuck."
2.  **Real-World Knowledge**: Leverages Gemini 3's reasoning for precise, detailed results.
    *   *Prompt*: "Create an infographic that shows how to make elaichi chai"
3.  **Translate and Localize**: Translate text inside images or generate localized visuals for international markets.
    *   *Prompt*: "translate all the English text on the three yellow and blue cans into Korean, while keeping everything else the same"
4.  **Studio-Quality Control**: Directly influence lighting, angle, focus, and color grading.
    *   *Prompt*: "Focus on the flowers", "Turn this scene into nighttime"
5.  **Precision Resizing**: Change aspect ratios for different platforms while maintaining visual integrity.
    *   *Example*: Adapting a 16:9 cinematic shot to a vertical format.
6.  **Image Blending & Character Consistency**: Blend up to 14 unconnected images or maintain character consistency across shots.
    *   *Prompt*: "Combine these images into one appropriately arranged cinematic image in 16:9 format and change the dress on the mannequin to the dress in the image."
7.  **Brand Look and Feel**: Apply consistent brand styling, patterns, and logos to 3D objects and surfaces.
    *   *Prompt*: "Create a smooth logo in a graphic style... deeply rooted in the retro aesthetics of the 1960s and 1970s... The word 'WAVE' is artfully arranged into the fluid silhouette of a wave."

## 4. Current Limitations
Be aware of areas still under improvement:
*   **Visual and Text Fidelity**: Small text or fine details may not always be perfect.
*   **Accuracy**: Always verify data-driven visuals like diagrams.
*   **Translation**: Multilingual generation may miss strict cultural nuances or grammar.
*   **Complex Edits**: Advanced blending or lighting changes might produce artifacts.
*   **Character Features**: Consistency across edits is reliable but may vary in complex scenes.
